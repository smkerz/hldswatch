hldswatch is a very nice HLDS/SRCDS manager.
It is not my code but I'd like to share this little script I found 3 years ago here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=186620
I could not find it on Internet anymore so I managed to find an old save on a dedicated server of mine and share it here.<br/>

Possible future update:
- Manage a reboot when the map crash a server
